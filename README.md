# Gus

AI-assisted repository workflow automation. Gus inspects your repository changes, proposes a
structured workflow plan, asks for approval according to your configuration, and performs only the
approved branch, staging, and commit operations.

Gus is not a coding agent. It manages repository workflows and never lets the AI execute commands.

## Requirements

- Node.js 20 or newer
- Git
- An OpenAI API key in `OPENAI_API_KEY` for AI planning

## Install

```bash
npm install -g gus
# or run without installing
npx gus
```

## Commands

```bash
# Run the default workflow
gus

# Preview the plan without changing the repository
gus --dry-run

# Approve every operation without prompting (useful in CI)
gus --yes

# Override the provider or model for one run
gus --provider openai --model gpt-4o

# Inspect repository state
gus status

# Inspect and update configuration
gus config get ai.model
gus config set ai.model gpt-4o --global

# Show the configured provider and model
gus models

# Create project starter files in .gus/
gus init
```

The explicit `gus run` command accepts the same workflow options.

## Configuration

Gus reads configuration in this order, with later sources taking precedence:

1. Built-in defaults
2. Global configuration: `~/.config/gus/config.json`
3. Project configuration: `.gus/config.json` in the repository root
4. Per-run overrides such as `--provider` and `--model`

`gus config set` writes to the project configuration when run inside a repository, and to the global
configuration otherwise. Use `--global` or `--project` to choose explicitly.

Supported keys:

| Key | Values | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ai.provider` | provider name | `openai` |
| `ai.model` | model identifier | `gpt-4o-mini` |
| `ai.temperature` | number from 0 to 2 | unset |
| `workflow.autoCommit` | `allow`, `ask`, `deny` | `ask` |
| `workflow.autoCreateBranch` | `allow`, `ask`, `deny` | `ask` |
| `workflow.autoStage` | `allow`, `ask`, `deny` | `ask` |
| `workflow.splitChanges` | `allow`, `ask`, `deny` | `ask` |
| `workflow.commitStyle` | string | unset |
| `workflow.defaultBranch` | string | unset |
| `ui.liveUpdates` | `true`, `false` | unset |
| `ui.color` | `auto`, `always`, `never` | unset |
| `privacy.excludedPaths` | comma-separated globs or JSON string array | sensitive built-ins |
| `privacy.redactSecrets` | `true`, `false` | `true` |
| `privacy.acknowledgeDataUsage` | `true`, `false` | `false` |

`ui.liveUpdates: false` disables live progress output. `ui.color` is accepted but reserved for a
future release; color output currently follows the terminal environment (`NO_COLOR`,
`FORCE_COLOR`).

Policy values:

- `allow`: perform the operation without prompting.
- `ask`: request approval before performing the operation.
- `deny`: do not perform the operation.

## Privacy and data handling

Gus sends the inspected diffs, added file content, instructions, and metadata for changed files to
the configured AI provider. Files matching `privacy.excludedPaths` are never read, sent to the
provider, or committed. They stay untouched in the working tree and are reported in the workflow
output, so the final repository may still contain those local changes.

Built-in exclusions cover common sensitive paths such as `**/.env*`, `**/*.key`, `**/*.pem`,
`**/id_rsa*`, `**/secrets/**`, and `**/credentials/**`. User-defined exclusions extend the built-in
list; they cannot remove it.

```bash
# Add project-specific exclusions alongside the built-in list
gus config set privacy.excludedPaths "generated/**, **/*.local.json"

# Built-in exclusions are always retained
```

With `privacy.redactSecrets: true` (the default), Gus redacts common credentials and tokens across the
entire prompt, including instructions, templates, metadata, diffs, and file content. Disable it only
if you understand that provider-bound content is no longer filtered.

When the configured provider appears to be free-tier, Gus warns that submitted data may be used to
improve the provider's products. For example, the Google Gemini Developer API free tier states that
submitted content may be used to improve Google products. Set
`privacy.acknowledgeDataUsage: true` after reviewing your provider's terms to suppress that warning.
Approval prompts are separate from the data-usage acknowledgement.

## Instructions and templates

- `~/.config/gus/GUS.md` and `.gus/GUS.md` provide workflow instructions. Project instructions are
  combined with global instructions.
- `.gus/TEMPLATE.md` overrides `~/.config/gus/TEMPLATE.md` for commit message formatting.
- `gus init` creates `.gus/GUS.md`, `.gus/TEMPLATE.md`, and `.gus/config.json` without overwriting
  existing files.

## Safety behavior

- All AI output is validated against a Zod schema and the inspected repository state before anything
  changes.
- Only explicitly planned paths are staged. If the repository already has staged work, Gus refuses to
  mix it into the workflow.
- Unsafe states such as an in-progress merge, rebase, or cherry-pick block execution.
- If the repository changes between planning and execution, the plan is rejected.
- Gus never pushes, rewrites history, or runs arbitrary commands.
- Failed operations are reported accurately, including any partial work that remains.

## Non-interactive use and exit codes

When an operation requires approval and no interactive terminal is available, Gus fails safely
instead of waiting. Pass `--yes` to approve operations automatically.

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | Success |
| `1` | Unexpected internal error |
| `2` | Invalid command-line input or configuration |
| `3` | No supported repository, or an unsafe repository state |
| `4` | AI provider, authentication, or response failure |
| `5` | Approval required, unavailable, or denied by policy |
| `6` | Workflow failed; the repository may be in a partial state |

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # run the CLI from source
npm run build        # bundle to dist/
npm run test:run     # run the test suite once
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
```

Gus follows a layered architecture: `cli/` → `application/` → `domain/`, with `infrastructure/`
implementing ports defined by the application. See `MODEL.md` for the full design.
